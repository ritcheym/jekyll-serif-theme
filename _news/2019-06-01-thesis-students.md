Congrats to all of the seniors graduating from the MemoLab: Lunbei Hu, Emily Iannazzi, Maria Khoudary, Samantha Murphy, Julia Napoli, Paula Ruiz, and Rahul Walia. We are thankful for your dedication and insights - we really couldn't do this work without you.

A special shout-out to honors thesis students Maria Khoudary and Emily Iannazzi, who completed their thesis projects in the lab. Maria will be moving on to a position as lab manager in the De Brigard lab at Duke, and Emily will be moving on to a position as a post-bacc research assistant in the Buckner lab at Harvard.
